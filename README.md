# Road-Lane-Detection

The objective of this assignment is the detection of road lanes in an image using Hough Transform.

The Hough transform can be used to determine the parameters of a line when a number of
points that fall on it are known. The normal form of a line can be described with the following
equation: x cos θ + y sin θ = ρ where ρ is the length of a line that starts from the origin and
perpendicular to the required line, and θ is its inclination. The true parameters ρ and θ will
get maximum votes from the line points, and can be found with a Hough accumulation array.

Here is the final output but please refer to the notebook as it's well documnetetd and contains all
the steps and implementation details:<br>
